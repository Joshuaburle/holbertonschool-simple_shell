.SH NAME
shell \- simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shell
is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input. This shell is designed for educational purposes as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

.SH INVOCATION
The shell can be invoked in two modes:

.SS Interactive mode
When 
.B shell
is invoked without arguments, it displays a prompt 
.RB ( "#cisfun$ " )
and waits for user input.

.SS Non-interactive mode
When 
.B shell
receives input from a pipe or file, it reads and executes commands without displaying a prompt.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
Commands are executed by searching for the command name in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable. If the command contains a slash 
.RB ( / ),
it is executed directly.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS

.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell with the status of the last executed command.

.TP
.B exit \fR[\fIstatus\fR]
Exit the shell with the specified numeric status code.

.TP
.B env
Print all environment variables to standard output.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B shell
exits with the status of the last command executed. If no command is executed, it exits with status 0.

Built-in commands:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
.B exit
exits with the specified status or the last command's exit status
.IP \(bu 2
.B env
exits with status 0 on success
.RE

External commands exit with their own status codes:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
0 on success
.IP \(bu 2
127 if command not found
.IP \(bu 2
126 if permission denied
