HSH(1)                                User Commands                                HSH(1)

NAME
       hsh - simple UNIX command interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       ./hsh

       echo "command" | ./hsh

       cat file | ./hsh

DESCRIPTION
       hsh  is a simple UNIX command line interpreter written in C as part of the
       Holberton School curriculum. It provides a minimal set of features similar
       to sh(1), allowing users to execute programs from the system.

       The shell supports both interactive and non-interactive modes, PATH-based
       command resolution, and a small set of built-in commands.

MODES OF OPERATION
       Interactive mode
              Runs when standard input is connected to a terminal. The shell displays
              the prompt:

                  ($)

              Then waits for the user to type a command followed by a newline.

       Non-interactive mode
              Runs when standard input is redirected or piped into the shell. Commands
              are read and executed sequentially without printing a prompt.

BUILT-IN COMMANDS
       exit
              Exit the shell. This built-in takes no arguments. The shell exits with
              the status of the last executed command.

       env
              Print the current environment variables, one per line, in the format:

                  NAME=value

COMMAND EXECUTION
       The shell executes commands according to the following logic:

       1. Read one line from standard input using getline(3).
       2. If end-of-file is reached (Ctrl+D in interactive mode, or end of input in
          non-interactive mode), the shell exits.
       3. Parse the line into tokens (command and arguments) separated by spaces/tabs.
       4. If the command is a built-in (exit or env), handle it immediately.
       5. Otherwise, resolve the command:
              - If the command contains '/', it is treated as a direct path.
              - Otherwise, the shell searches executable files in directories listed
                in the PATH environment variable.
       6. If the command cannot be found, the shell prints an error message and
          returns to the main loop. fork(2) is not called in this case.
       7. If found, the shell creates a child process using fork(2), executes the
          command in the child with execve(2), and waits for completion in the parent
          using waitpid(2).
       8. The exit status of the last executed command is stored and used as the
          shell’s return value and as the exit status for the exit built-in.

RETURN VALUES
       The return value of hsh is the exit status of the last executed command.

       The following exit codes are typically used:
       0      Success
       1      General error (e.g., fork failure, wait failure, other runtime errors)
       126    Permission denied / command found but not executable
       127    Command not found

ERROR MESSAGES
       Error messages are printed to standard error and follow this format:

           <program>: <command_number>: <command>: <message>

       Example:
           ./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found

ENVIRONMENT
       PATH   A colon-separated list of directories used to search for commands when
              no '/' is present in the command name.

       environ
              The current environment is passed unchanged to executed programs.

LIMITATIONS
       This educational shell does not support:
       - Command separators (;, &&, ||)
       - Pipes (|)
       - Redirections (<, >, >>)
       - Wildcards (*) or globbing
       - Quoting or escaping (", ', \)
       - Environment variable expansion ($VAR)
       - Job control (&, fg, bg)
       - Command history or line editing

EXAMPLES
       Interactive usage:
           $ ./hsh
           ($) /bin/ls
           file.c  hsh  shell.c  shell.h
           ($) env
           PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
           HOME=/home/user
           ($) exit
           $

       Non-interactive usage:
           $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
           file.c  hsh  shell.c  shell.h
